              "       'Recently a teacher, a garbage collector, and a lawyer wound up together at the Pearly Gates. St. Peter informed them that in order to get into Heaven, they would each have to answer one question. St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, \"What was the name of the ship that crashed into the iceberg? They just made a movie about it.\" The teacher answered quickly, \"That would be the Titanic.\" St. Peter let him through the gate. St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didn\\'t really need all the odors that this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder: \"How many people died on the ship?\" Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie. \"1,228,\" he answered. \"That\\'s right! You may enter.\" St. Peter turned to the lawyer: \"Name them.\"',\n",

Carter was speaking at a business lunch in Tokyo, where he decided to open his speech with a brief joke. He told the joke, then waited for the translator to announce the Japanese version. Even though the story was quite short, Carter was surprised by how quickly the interpreter was able to re-tell it. Even more impressive was the reaction from the crowd. Carter thought the story was cute, but not outright hilarious, yet the crowd broke right up. Carter was very flattered. After the speech, Carter wanted to meet the translator to ask him how he told the joke. Perhaps there is better way to tell the joke? When Carter asked how the joke had been told in Japanese, the translator responded, \"I told them, \\'President Carter has told a very funny joke. Please laugh now.\\'\"'],\n",

            "The joke with the most words is: A group of girlfriends is on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads: \"For Women Only.\" Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in. The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. \"We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. It's easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you what's inside.\" So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads: \"All the men on this floor are short and plain.\" The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. The sign on the second floor reads: \"All the men here are short and handsome.\" Still, this isn't good enough, so the friends continue on up. They reach the third floor and the sign reads: \"All the men here are tall and plain.\" They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up. On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect: \"All the men here are tall and handsome.\" The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. There they find a sign that reads: \"There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.\"\n",

They had tried everything and  everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail.  In  desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so  many of their problems in the past. The engineer reluctantly took the challenge.  He spent a day studying  the huge machine.  At the end of the day, he marked a small \"x\" in  chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,  \"This is where your problem is\". The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The  company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his  service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The  engineer responded briefly: One chalk mark                       $1  Knowing where to put it            $49,999 It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.\n",

At the end of the day, he marked a small \"x\" in  chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,  \"This is where your problem is\". The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The  company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his  service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges.

They had tried everything and  everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail.  In  desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so  many of their problems in the past.

The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The  company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his  service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The  engineer responded briefly: One chalk mark                       $1  Knowing where to put it            $49,999 It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.\n",

They had tried everything and  everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail.  In  desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so  many of their problems in the past.

The engineer reluctantly took the challenge.  He spent a day studying  the huge machine.  At the end of the day, he marked a small \"x\" in  chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,  \"This is where your problem is\". The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The  company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his  service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges.
